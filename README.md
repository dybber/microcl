# MicroCL

### Easy wrapper functions for [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) programming

This library provides a set of functions for compiling and executing
OpenCL kernels from within a C program. The intension is for this
library to be very lightweight and at the same time provide good error
messages in case of kernel compilation errors, etc.

The API is documented in the file [mcl.h](mcl.h).
